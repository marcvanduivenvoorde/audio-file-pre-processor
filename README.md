# Audio pre-processor

## 1. Idea and reason 

This project provides a small Python tool (`audio-pre-processor.py`) for preparing **WAV** files before further work (mixing, mastering, batch pipelines, etc.).

Given a **source folder**, the script scans **top-level** `*.wav` files, classifies each by channel layout (mono, false stereo, true stereo), and writes outputs under `**pre-processed/`** (and true-stereo left/right mono splits under `**pre-processed/split-stereo/**`). True stereo also gets a stereo copy with a `-S` suffix in `pre-processed/`. Filenames are **slugged** (lowercase, alphanumeric and dashes only). By default, **levels are unchanged** (samples written as float32). Pass **`--normalize`** to run **crest-aware loudness normalization** (see below).

**Why it exists:** to automate a consistent first pass: split true stereo to dual mono where needed, collapse duplicate L/R to a single mono file, copy mono sources with a clear `-M` suffix, optionally apply crest-aware normalization, and require an explicit **preview and confirmation** before any files are written—so you see the plan before touching disk.

### Normalization method and targets (`--normalize`)

Normalization uses **dBFS** relative to full scale (floating-point samples in roughly **±1.0**).

**Crest factor** (per output buffer—each `-L`, `-R`, `-M`, or `-S` file) is `**20 * log10(peak / RMS)`** in dB, using linear **peak** (max absolute sample) and **RMS** (root mean square of samples) over the frames that count (see below).

**RMS** and **peak** for that formula are computed only on samples that remain after **ignoring long silence**:

- A time frame is **silent** if its peak magnitude is below **−60 dBFS** (mono: absolute sample value; stereo: max of |L| and |R| per frame).
- Any **single contiguous** run of silent frames **strictly longer than 0.5 seconds** is **excluded** from the RMS/peak used for crest and for choosing the gain rule. Shorter gaps stay in the stats. The **gain is still applied to the whole waveform**; only the *measurement* ignores those long silent stretches.

**Bands and target levels** (chosen from crest on the retained audio):


| Crest factor              | What the script does                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 11 dB**               | Gain so **RMS = −21 dBFS**.                                                                                                               |
| **11 dB ≤ crest ≤ 14 dB** | Gain so **RMS = −21 dBFS**, then if the **full** signal (after that gain) would peak above **−9 dBFS**, scale down so peak **≤ −9 dBFS**. |
| **> 14 dB**               | **Peak** normalize so peak **= −9 dBFS** (using peak from the non–long-silence stats for the gain divisor).                               |


Nearly silent material (no usable stats) is left unchanged. Constants in code: `RMS_TARGET_DBFS = -21`, `PEAK_CAP_DBFS = -9`, crest band edges **11** and **14** dB, **0.5 s** long-silence threshold.

## 2. Python environment (`.venv`)

Use a virtual environment in the **project root** so dependencies stay isolated.

**Create the venv** (from the repository root):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

**Activate it** (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Install dependencies:**

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need **Python 3** with `pip`. The script depends on **NumPy** and **SoundFile** (and a working system backend for audio I/O, as provided by SoundFile/libsndfile on most setups).

## 3. Command-line usage

Run the script with Python, passing the **source directory** that contains the WAV files to process:

```powershell
python .\audio-pre-processor.py "C:\path\to\your\source_folder"
```

## 4. GUI usage

Run the desktop GUI (Tkinter) from the repository root:

```powershell
python .\audio-pre-processor-gui.py
```

The GUI uses the same processing engine as the CLI (`run_processor(...)` in `audio-pre-processor.py`), so behavior and options stay consistent.

### Arguments and options


| Item                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `**source_dir**` (positional, required) | Directory whose **immediate** contents are scanned for `.wav` files. It is not recursive into subfolders.                                                                 |
| `**--dry-run`**                         | Print the plan (inputs, output paths, per-output normalize row) and **exit without writing** any files or creating folders. Does not show the confirmation prompt.        |
| `**--normalize`**                       | Compute crest factor per output and apply loudness normalization (see section 1). **Without** this flag, outputs keep source levels (no crest math, no gain).              |
| `**--yes`**                             | **Skip** the interactive “Proceed with processing? (y/N)” prompt and run immediately after printing the plan.                                                             |
| `**--overwrite`**                       | Allow **replacing** output files if they already exist. Without this flag, existing outputs cause a write error for that file.                                            |


### Exit codes

- **0** — Finished successfully (including dry-run, or nothing to do).
- **1** — Error (e.g. invalid path, read/write failures).
- **2** — You declined the confirmation prompt (not used with `--yes`).

### Examples

```powershell
# Preview only
python .\audio-pre-processor.py "D:\audio\inbox" --dry-run

# Run without confirmation (e.g. in automation), levels unchanged
python .\audio-pre-processor.py "D:\audio\inbox" --yes

# Same, with crest-based normalization
python .\audio-pre-processor.py "D:\audio\inbox" --yes --normalize

# Overwrite previous outputs in pre-processed / split-stereo
python .\audio-pre-processor.py "D:\audio\inbox" --yes --overwrite
```
